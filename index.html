    <p style="color: deeppink; font-style: italic; font-size: 150; font-weight: bold;">We, SAI Shree International Academy set up at Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh, believe in providing academic excellence, better growth in initial days of learning as well as child care to our associated students. In order to achieve this we have a team of dedicated teachers, professionals and staff who channelize their energy and resources towards child-centered qualitative learning and personality development. We help students gain a strong foundation and develop into holistic beings. During these years, the smooth transition from childhood to adolescence is facilitated by value-added education. We focus on building a strong foundation for learning and developing the young minds. Providing high-quality education - right from preschool - is our goal and commitment. While learning comes naturally to children with simpler teaching methods, we facilitate and build on this newly developing ability. We pride ourselves in taking the initiative to give something back to society and imbibing utmost knowledge and compassion in our students.</p>

<p2 style="color: deeppink; font-style: italic; font-size: 150; font-weight: bold;">The SAI SHREE INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY aims to be an institution of excellence, dedicated to producing leaders of the future. To fulfill the vision, The SAI SHREE INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY School provides an environment in which every student discovers and realizes his full potential. The school should attract the best talent-students, teachers and facilitators- from all parts of distinction of race, religion, caste, or social status. The SAI SHREE INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY, must maintain a sharp focus on the pursuit of knowledge and skill. In particular, it must attain the highest academic standards.
 
Our aim is to develop students who are aware, socially responsible, creative, clear thinking, explorative, and with good self-management and interactive skills.
To empower our students on the path to becoming Global Citizens, our assessment criteria follow an all-round structure. At Sai Shree International Academy, we have recognized the limitations of the year-end evaluation system. As a result, we consider evaluation as an integral part of the learning and teaching process. Evaluations are integrated into the classroom sessions to enable students to progress over an extended course of evaluation. The advantage in this process is that it enables teachers to obtain feedback during every stage of the learning process and take corrective action where required. In addition, it also helps teachers to better their teaching methodology.
Empowered Assessment
The school also holds three sets of comprehensive tests during the course of the academic year. This quarterly structure is based on developing logical and critical reasoning. Both theoretical and practical aspects of each subject are taken into consideration for evaluation.
From Orals to annuals in languages to presentations, plays, dramas, projects in History, Geography and the Sciences, to games and mental enhancement exercises in Arithmetic, we ensure that every one of our students develops their ability to apply themselves.</p2>
